# Project-2---Webscraped-Data-Analysis-
Project was about scraping the information of a website into Jupyter Notebook and then taking specific bits of the information to make command prompts to display said information in a different format.
The only other file on here is the .ipynb file that does some of that.
Extra file addes for resource used for help.
